Description: Inspired by the 'reactable', ContrApption takes a dataset consisting of 1) a numeric
            matrix or dataframe in which each column is an observation (sample) and each row is a
            feature (gene) and 2) an annotation table where the rows correspond to the columns of
            the numeric matrix and provides information on which samples belong to which experimental
            group. ContrApption uses the files to create an interactive HTML widget using the d3 and
            plotly-js JavaScript libraries. Users can select features of interest and the plot widget
            will update in real time.
